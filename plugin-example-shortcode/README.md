plg-shortcodes
==============

This is an example content plugin which serves as a 
[plugin tutorial](https://manual.joomla.org/docs/building-extensions/plugins/basic-content-plugin/).

It handles the events onContentPrepare and onContentAfterTitle, and:

- replaces article shortcodes (in {} brackets) with field values (from the Joomla global configuration)
- adds text after titles in articles, contacts, etc.

It demonstrates the functionality described in 
[Plugin Methods and Arguments](https://manual.joomla.org/docs/building-extensions/plugins/methods-and-arguments/).
